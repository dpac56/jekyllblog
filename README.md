==========
The only thing interesting here is how to put different content in a Jekyll page. Apparently there is no easy way to do that unless you make use of some include statements. And used liquid filters. 

I also wanted to iterate through posts with a counter & tried various things like capture counter & assign counter. Turns out the only thing that worked was the treat the for loop as an object itself.
